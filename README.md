# NSU Hackathon 2021 - HackNSU Season 4

Problem Statement: Design a solution for tackling climate change.

This project comprises a mobile application designed to promote environmental awareness amongst ordinary citizens. The mobile app, developed using JavaFx and Java enables users to compete against each other in completing tasks 
designed to help fight climate change, e.g - plant a tree, replace filament bulb with energy-saving bulb, recycle plastic bottles. Our prize winning proposal was that if we give ordinary citizens a competetive 
incentive to act sustainably then we could generate greater environmental awareness.

I have worked on this project with my teammates Absara Chowdhury, Farhan Ishrak Tahmid, and Nijhum Tanha.

We ranked 1st in the Hackathon.
